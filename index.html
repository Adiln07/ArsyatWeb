              <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
              <!-- <p>
                The Beatles were an English four-piece rock band, formed in
                Liverpool in 1960. <br /><br />

                The members of the band were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George
                Harrison and Ringo Starr, with John and Ringo playing the
                guitar, Paul on bass guitar and Ringo on the drums. <br /><br />

                In March 1956, John Lennon, aged 16, and a few of his friends
                from school played in a skiffle band called the Quarrymen. After
                meeting John in the July of that year, Paul McCartney joined the
                band as a rhythm guitarist and invited his friend George
                Harrison to watch the band perform. George then auditioned to be
                in the band, but John thought that he was too young, however,
                after several months of persistence, he performed lead guitar in
                a performance as was enlisted as their lead guitarist.
                <br /><br />

                By January 1959, John’s friends from school had left, and he
                began studying at Liverpool College of Art. The three
                guitarists, John, Paul and George, were playing under the name
                Johnny and the Moondogs, and playing rock and roll whenever they
                could find a drummer. <br /><br />

                Stuart Sutcliffe, an art college friend of John and band member,
                suggested that the band name should be Beatals, as a tribute to
                Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May of
                1959, where they went to the Silver Beetles, the Silver Beatles
                and then in August, shortened to simply The Beatles.
              </p> -->
              <p class="">
                That encounter began in the most ordinary way—just a simple plan
                to share a meal with my fellow interns. I never imagined that in
                the midst of laughter, casual conversations, and the lively
                atmosphere around the table, there would be someone whose
                presence quietly captured my attention. The moment my eyes met
                theirs, something inside me shifted. It wasn’t loud or dramatic,
                but a subtle spark of curiosity, a gentle tug that made me want
                to know more about this person who had suddenly become so
                intriguing.
              </p>

              <p>
                At first, everything seemed so small, almost trivial—just stolen
                glances across the table, fleeting eye contact that quickly
                disappeared, yet lingered in my mind long after. No words were
                exchanged, yet those silent moments carried their own meaning.
                Over time, that curiosity grew stronger, slowly evolving into
                genuine attraction. It felt as if the universe was sending me
                quiet signals, guiding me toward something special, something
                that felt safe, familiar, and profoundly right.
              </p>

              <p>
                And now, that once-simple beginning has unfolded into something
                far greater: a bond built on love. From a moment that could have
                easily been forgotten, we now share a story worth remembering.
                This journey has shown me that love doesn’t always come with
                fireworks or grand gestures. Sometimes, it arrives softly,
                hidden within the simplest encounters, only to leave the deepest
                mark on the heart. And in those unspoken glances, in those
                ordinary beginnings, I found something extraordinary—love that
                feels both destined and real.

            <div class="article-2_text">
              <h1>The Early 1960s</h1>
              <p>
                In August 1960, their unofficial manager Allan Williams had
                booked a residency for the band in Hamburg, but without a
                full-time drummer, they had to audition for a new band member.
                They auditioned and hired Pete Best in the same month. Six days
                after hiring Pete, they left for Hamburg for a 3 and a half
                month residency. The Beatles played in Hamburg in several
                different locations, but mainly in the red-light district.
                <br /><br />

                TStuart Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early, in 1961,
                making Paul the bassist, and they were signed into another
                contract in Hamburg until June 1962. After their second
                residency, they became increasingly popular in Liverpool with
                the Merseybeat movement, but they were growing tired of playing
                the same clubs night after night. <br /><br />

                During one of their performances at The Cavern Club, they met
                Brian Epstein – a local store owner and music columnist. He
                became their manager in 1962, after courting them for a couple
                of months. Brian eventually released the band from contractual
                obligations in Hamburg a month early in exchange for a recording
                session. In April, the band was met with horrific news:
                Sutcliffe had died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage.
                <br /><br />

                Three months later, Brian negotiated a deal with George Martin,
                the owner of EMI’s Parlophone label. Their first recording
                session with George Martin took place on 6th June 1962, at EMI’s
                Abbey Road Studios. Martin immediately complained about Best’s
                drumming ability, and suggested a session drummer in his place.
                The band was already considering dismissing Best, and therefore
                hired Ringo Starr in August 1962. Starr left his band, Rory
                Storm and the Hurricanes, to join them. <br /><br />

                SDuring their third session with Martin, The Beatles recorded
                Love Me Do, Please Please Me and P.S. I Love You with Starr on
                the drums, but George was dissatisfied and got Andy White, a
                session drummer, to take Ringo’s place in the song, with Ringo
                on the tambourine. Love Me Do was released, and peaked at number
                17 on the Record Retailer chart. Martin suggested that Please
                Please Me should be a faster tempo, and recording took place in
                November. Martin accurately predicted “you’ve just made your
                first number one.” <br /><br />

                In 1963, the band decided that all four members should
                contribute vocals to their albums, despite Starr’s limited vocal
                range. As Lennon and McCarthy established a songwriting
                partnership, it meant that it limited Harrison’s opportunities
                as lead vocalist. George Martin suggested that, if they were to
                be a success, they should change their ways – stop eating,
                swearing and smoking on stage.

            <div class="article-3_text">
              <h1>Beatlemania</h1>
              <p>
                On 11th February 1963, The Beatles recorded ten songs during a
                single studio session for their debut album, Please Please Me.
                After the positive reaction to their first single Love Me Do,
                the single Please Please Me was met with a bigger reaction, and
                reached number one on every UK chart except Record Retailer,
                where it reached number two. <br /><br />

                Due to their commercial success, it increased their media
                exposure – the Beatles became known for their comical attitude
                as this was different to other pop artists at the time. Due to
                their attitude and behaviour, they become even more of an
                interest to their fans. When they performed live and toured the
                UK, the band was greeted with screaming fans, which the press
                dubbed Beatlemania. Whilst supporting Tommy Roe and Chris
                Montez, the Beatles overshadowed the artists and assumed top
                billing ‘by audience demand’ – this was something that had never
                happened to a British act whilst touring with artists from the
                US. <br /><br />

                After a 5-day tour in Sweden, the band was met by hundreds of
                screaming fans and around 100 journalists and photographers. Due
                to the fans, police had to resort to using high-pressure water
                hoses at a concert in Plymouth. Please Please Me maintained at
                the top of the charts for 30 weeks, to be displaced with its
                follow up, With the Beatles.
                <br /><br />

                In 1964, The Beatles made their US debut on The Ed Sullivan Show
                on 9th February 1964 – where around 74 million viewers (around
                half of the US population) watched the performance. <br /><br />

                The Beatles visited America when the nation was still mourning
                the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous
                year, and commentators have suggested that the band reignited
                the excitement within the country and helped make way for the
                revolutionary changes to come in the next decade. The interest
                in the Beatles generated unprecedented interest in British
                music, and groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and the
                Animals made their American debuts within the next three years.
                <br /><br />

                The Beatles’ songs filled the top 5 places on the American Top
                40 chart, a feat which has, to this day, never been matched.
                <br /><br />

                The band stopped touring in 1966 as they were getting tired of
                the audience screaming so loudly that the music couldn’t be
                heard. It marked the end of four years of non-stop touring, and
                a total of 1,400 appearances internationally.

              <h1>The Beatles’ Separation</h1>
              <p>
                After tensions between the band members grew after disagreements
                over who would manage their finances, on 20th September 1969,
                Lennon announced that he would leave the band. It was agreed
                that he would withhold an announcement to the public, avoiding
                the potential drop in sales of their upcoming album. This
                important event is documented in our 1969 timeline, joined with
                other iconic moments that happened in that year. <br /><br />

                Abbey Road was released on 26th September and sold more than
                four million copies within three months – it also topped the UK
                charts for seventeen weeks in total. <br /><br />

                On the 31st December 1970, Paul McCartney filed for the
                dissolution of the Beatles’ contractual partnership. It was met
                with legal difficulties and it was not formalised until 29th
                December 1974, where John Lennon signed the paperwork whilst on
                holiday with his family at Walt Disney World Resort, in Florida.
